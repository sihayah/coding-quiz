Intended behavior:

This is a coding quiz application composed with dynamically generated elements composed primarily in JavaScript with CSS style. 

User is prompted to start quiz via a button. Then a series of questions are asked. Upon answering, user can see whether their answer was correct or incorrect. Each correct answer adds a point to the users score. A high score list is available to view. 

When the timer runs out, if the user has beaten the highscore, they are prompted to save their initials to a database.

Current bugs to fix:

-highscore list is not updating with new data input
-data input is not being saved to highscore dataobject
